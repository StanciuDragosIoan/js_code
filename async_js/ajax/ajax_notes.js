    AJAX  = Asynchronous JS and XML;

    -a set of web technologies;
    -used to send and receive data asynchronously;
    -does not interfere with the current page;
    -JSON has replaced XML for the most part;
*/

/*
    With AJAX we make an asynchronous request in the background
    The request is made to an Ajax engine which sends it to the server
    The server sends a response of JSON (or XML/text) which we parse as HTML in our app
    This is done behind the scenes without any page reload
*/

/*
    The XmlHttpRequest(XHR) Object is a browser API
    -its methods transfer data between client/server
    -can be used with other protocols than http
    -works with json/xml/text, mostly json;
*/

/*
    Other methods besides AJAX:
        Fetch API
        Axios
        jQuery
        node HTTP Client
